    <h2>3. What is Role of Node Js in react Js?</h2>

    <p>
        Node.js and React.js are both JavaScript technologies. But the uses of Node.js and React.js are entirely different. Node.js is a framework of JavaScript which is mainly used for working with the backend of our application or building the backend using JavaScript, whereas React.js is a JavaScript front-end library. It is mainly used for building the user interface or the frontend of our application. Though both are used for different purposes, both these technologies make our application faster and easy to handle.

    <p>
        Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node.js can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications. Node.js is often used in conjunction with front-end frameworks like React.js to build full-stack web applications.

    <p>
        Node.js and React.js are two of the most popular JavaScript technologies today. They are both open-source and have large communities of developers. Node.js and React.js are used by companies of all sizes, from startups to large enterprises.
