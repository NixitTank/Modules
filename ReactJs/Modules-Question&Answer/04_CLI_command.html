    <h2>4. What is CLI command In React Js?</h2>

    <p>
        CLI stands for Command Line Interface. It is a text-based user interface that allows users to interact with a computer or computer program by typing commands.
    </p>

    <p>
        In React, CLI commands can be used to automate tasks such as creating new React applications, generating React components, and running React applications. Some of the most commonly used CLI commands in React include:
    </p>

    <li>create-react-app: This command creates a new React application.
    </li>
    <li>react-generate: This command generates a new React component.
    </li>
    <li>react-scripts: This command runs a React application.
    </li>

    <p>
        In addition to these commands, there are many other CLI commands that can be used with React. For more information, please refer to the documentation for the specific CLI tool that you are using.
