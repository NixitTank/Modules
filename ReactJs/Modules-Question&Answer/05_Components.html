    <h2>5. What is Components in React Js?</h2>

    <p>
        Components are the building blocks of React applications. They are reusable pieces of code that can be used to create user interfaces. Components can be simple, like a button or a text input, or they can be more complex, like a navigation bar or a photo gallery.
    </p>

    <p>
        Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function. Components come in two types, Class components and Function components.
    </p>

    <p>
        Class components are defined using the class keyword. They must include a render() method that returns HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
        Function components are defined using a regular JavaScript function. They also require a render() method that returns HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
        Components can be nested inside of other components. This allows you to create complex user interfaces out of smaller, more manageable pieces.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is an example of a simple React component:


        <pre class="border">
            function Welcome(props) {
                return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}!&lt;/h1&gt;;
              }
        </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        This component takes a name prop and returns an h1 element with the text "Hello, {props.name}!".
    </p>

    <p>
        Components can also have state. State is data that is specific to a component and can change over time. Components can use state to keep track of things like the value of a text input or the selected item in a list.

    </p>

    <br>


    <p>
        Here is an example of a React component with state:

        <pre class="border">

            class Counter extends React.Component {
                state = {
                  count: 0
                };
              
                handleClick() {
                  this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
                }
              
                render() {
                  return (
                    &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;h1>Count: {this.state.count}&lt;/h1&gt;
                        &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}>Increment&lt;/button&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                  );
                }
              }

        </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        This component has a state object that tracks the current count. The handleClick() method increments the count and the render() method displays the current count.

    </p>

    <p>
        Components are a powerful tool for creating reusable and maintainable user interfaces. They are the foundation of React applications.
