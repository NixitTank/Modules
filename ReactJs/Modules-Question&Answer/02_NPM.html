    <h2>2. What is NPM in React Js?</h2>

    <P>
        NPM stands for Node Package Manager, and it is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to install, uninstall, update, and manage JavaScript packages. NPM is a command-line tool, and it can be used to install packages from the npm registry, which is a public repository of over 800,000 packages.  
    </P>

    <p>
        In React, NPM is used to install and manage React packages, as well as other JavaScript packages that are used in React applications. For example, the React package can be installed with the following command:
        <br><br>
        <b class="border">npm install react</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the React package is installed, it can be imported into a React application with the following statement:
        <br><br>
        <b class="border">import React from 'react';</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        NPM can also be used to install other JavaScript packages that are used in React applications, such as the ReactDOM package, which is used to render React components to the DOM. The ReactDOM package can be installed with the following command:
        <br><br>
        <b class="border">npm install react-dom</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the ReactDOM package is installed, it can be imported into a React application with the following statement:
        <br><br>
        <b class="border">import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        NPM is a powerful tool that can be used to install and manage JavaScript packages in React applications. It is a valuable tool for any React developer.
