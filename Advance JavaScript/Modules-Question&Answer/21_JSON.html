    <h2>21. What is JSON</h2>

    <p>
        JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending data from a server to a client so it can be displayed on a web page).
    </p>

    <h3>Key Features of JSON:</h3>

    <p>
        <b>1. Text Format:</b>
        JSON is a plain text format that uses a structure similar to JavaScript object literals.
    </p>

            2. Data Structure:
        </b>

        It is based on two structures:

        <li>
            <b>
                A collection of name/value pairs:
            </b>

            In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>
                An ordered list of values:
            </b>
    
                In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.
        </li>
    </p>
