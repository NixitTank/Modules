    <h2>50.  What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects?</h2>


    <p>
        Declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects can lead to a drawback known as method duplication. When you declare methods directly within each object instance, each instance holds its own copy of the method. This can result in increased memory consumption, especially if the methods are large or complex.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, if you declare methods on the prototype of the object, they are shared among all instances of that object. This leads to better memory efficiency as the method is stored only once in memory, regardless of how many instances of the object are created. Additionally, if you later need to modify the method, you only need to do it in one place (the prototype), and all instances will automatically reflect the changes.
