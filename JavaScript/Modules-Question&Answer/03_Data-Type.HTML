    <p class="paragraph"><strong>Data Types</strong></p>

    <p>
      1. String<br />
      2. Number<br />
      3. Bigint<br />
      4. Boolean<br />
      5. Undefined<br />
      6. Null<br />
      7. Symbol<br />
      8. Object
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Number:</strong> JavaScript numbers are always stored in
      double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754. Unlike other programming
      languages, you don’t need int, float, etc to declare different numeric
      values.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>String:</strong> JavaScript Strings are similar to sentences. They
      are made up of a list of characters, which is essentially just an “array
      of characters, like “Hello GeeksforGeeks” etc
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Boolean:</strong> Represent a logical entity and can have two
      values: true or false.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Null:</strong> This type has only one value that is null.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Undefined:</strong> A variable that has not been assigned a value
      is undefined.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Symbol:</strong> Symbols return unique identifiers that can be
      used to add unique property keys to an object that won’t collide with keys
      of any other code that might add to the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>BigInt:</strong> BigInt is a built-in object in JavaScript that
      provides a way to represent whole numbers larger than 253-1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Object:</strong> It is the most important data type and forms the
      building blocks for modern JavaScript. We will learn about these data
      types in detail in further articles.
